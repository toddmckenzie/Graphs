'''

Given two words (begin_word and end_word), and a dictionary's word list,

return the shortest transformation sequence from begin_word to end_word, such that:

Only one letter can be changed at a time.

Each transformed word must exist in the word list.

Each transformed word must be the same length

Note that begin_word is not a transformed word.

​

Note:

Return None if there is no such transformation sequence.

All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.

You may assume no duplicates in the word list.

You may assume begin_word and end_word are non-empty and are not the same.

Sample:

begin_word = "hit"

end_word = "cog"

return: ['hit', 'hot', 'cot', 'cog']

begin_word = "sail"

end_word = "boat"

['sail', 'bail', 'boil', 'boll', 'bolt', 'boat']

beginWord = "hungry"

endWord = "happy"

None
